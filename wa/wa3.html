        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p> As a writer of fiction and an avid enjoyer of reading, there’s nothing I enthuse over more than listening to music that has a story to tell.
            <br><br>
            With all the books I can get my hands on, I can never put them down without leaving annotations. I pore over the words on the page and take them in with consideration, I find meaning in the smallest things, and I pay attention to the details otherwise glossed over because stories are meant to be contemplated and consumed. I don’t only do this with my books, I do this with everything. Honestly, I can’t help myself. 
            <br><br>
            I did this recently with an album I discovered about a year ago by an artist I truly admire. “Preacher’s Daughter” by Ethel Cain (which is what she’s more notoriously known by. Her real name is Hayden Silas Anhedönia) is a haunting work of fiction filled with the intricacy of spirituality and its motifs and southern gothic aesthetics. This album takes us on a journey with a troubled teenager, who is the preacher’s daughter, in her small southern town where she grapples with sexuality and her own religious trauma. 
            <br><br>
            But before you give this album a listen, because listening to religious turmoil in song form is sooo exciting, I feel like it would be incredibly beneficial to have some kind of understanding of the plot. By spending the past year listening to this album and continuously being amazed by the complexity in the lyricism, I feel confident in giving you a step-by-step beginner’s guide to the genius that is Ethel Cain’s debut album. 
            <br><br>
            The fictional character Ethel Cain loses lover after lover as she tries to develop her sense of self outside the church, but throughout the course of the album she is kidnapped and sold into prostitution. After trying to escape, her captor eventually killed and cannibalized her. Yes, you read that correctly. He eats her.
            I’ll take the liberty to put a disclaimer here now, I will be (as briefly as I can) talking about abuse, cannibalism, grooming, abuse, murder, and of course violence. Read and listen at your desire. 
             </p>

 <!--Family Tree(Intro)-->   
<div id="Family Tree(Into)">
<h2>Family Tree(Intro)</h2>
<p>The first song on the album is "Family Tree(Intro)", which sets the story in 1991. The structure of the story starts with a voice echoing in a church cathedral, who we can assume to be the preacher, Ethel's father. The themes of Christianity and intergenerational trauma are interwoven immediately with Ethel's words,
    <br>"Jesus can always reject his father / But he cannot escape his mother's blood / He'll scream and try to wash it off his fingers / But he'll never escape what he's made of."
    <br>Ethel describes the torment of being tied to something you desperately want to rid yourself of, and how she will always be tied to her family's bloodline with the lyric of, "Swinging by my neck from the family tree." With this imagery, Ethel is willingly dubjected to her trauma, which serves as foreshadowing for the rest of the album.
</p>
</div>

<!--American Teenager-->
<div id="American Teenager">
<h2>American Teenager</h2>
<p>“American Teenager” sets the scene in a small town in Alabama, where Ethel describes feeling frustrated over not being able to live the idyllic life of an American teenager. This song focuses on the glamorization of the stereotypical teenage lifestyle and what it promises growing kids, but the actual chance of it becoming real is nonexistent to Ethel. The start of her disconnection with God and religion comes from the line, “Jesus if you’re there / Why do I feel alone in this room with you?” 
<br><br>
    Being the preacher’s daughter, Ethel has this legacy in her hands and expectations she cannot meet with her questioning of religion. She is stuck wishing for a life that she has no real chance of getting—her faith in God is dwindling and she begins to drown her sorrows in alcohol to cope with this sudden shift in beliefs.
</p>
</div>

<!--A House in Nebraska-->
<div id="A House in Nebraska">
    <h2>A House in Nebraska</h2>
    <p>This next song is one of my favorites on the album. Here, Ethel reminisces on memories with an ex-lover name Willoughby Tucker(very Southern, I know). This song has a dramatic flair to it that most of the other songs don't, and Ethel's voice here takes its time to shine. There is this continuous yearning throughout the song, as Ethel remembers these good times with Willoughby and the plans they shared. In the middle of Nebraska, they planned on living in an abandoned house there in peace away from their hometown in Alabama. Ethel wishes he would return, but knows there is no hope, in the lines,
        <br>"And it hurts to miss you, but it's worse to know / That I'm the reason you won't come home / But I still call home that house in Nebraska."
        <br>She has no choice but to accept this loneliness.
    </p>
</div>

<!--Western Nights-->
<div id="Western Nights">
    <h2>Western Nights</h2>
    <p>With "Western Nights," we move out of the past and into the present, where themes of violence and abuse start to come to light. In this song we are introduced to Ethel's new lover, Logan Phelps who is supposedly very beautiful, rides a Harley, and loves to rob banks in his free time.
        <br><br> 
       It's hard to determine if Ethel truly loves Logan or not, but in these lines, "I watched him show his love / Through shades of black and blue," it's easy to see the confusion of feelings Ethel is having. Shades of black and blue refer to violence and bruises, and violence is no way of showing love. Ethel is making herself believe that what she has with Logan is love, because she sees him as a way to escape the life that's no longer suiting her. Ethel sings,
       <br>"Hold me across every state line / I'm never gonna leave you baby / Even if you lose what's left of your mind."
       <br>With this, she's promising herself <i>and</i> Logan that she'd stay in this abusive relationship if it meant freedom from her family legacy, her bloodline.
    </p>
</div>

<!--Family Tree-->
<div id="Family Tree">
    <p>Logan's criminal activities come to an end in "Family Tree," where he is caught by police after a bank robbery and fatally shot. Ethel's involvement in Logan's actions makes her an accomplice, forcing her to run away from the scene of the crime. This breaks all remaining ties that Ethel has with her hometown, she is in no place to return, she is metaphorically free--"These crosses all over my body / remind me of who I used to be."
        <br><br>
        The metaphor of the 'noose' in "Family Tree(Intro)" comes back in a different light. The noose is no longer keeping her captive, she now has the ability to take it off and use it to her own desires, "take the noose off, wrap it tight around my hand." Ethel, now on her own, wishes to wash herself from her sins: "So take me down to the river / And bathe me clean."
    </p>
</div>
    
<!--Hard Times-->
<div id="Hard Times">
<p>“Hard Times” goes into depth about some of the abuses Ethel had to endure from her father during her childhood, allowing the complicated feelings she has towards him to be addressed.
    <br><br>
    “I was too young to notice / That some types of love could be bad,” refers to Ethel’s inability to rid herself of the guilt and shame she is feeling over something that isn’t her fault. Her father, the preacher, a pillar to the community, is able to enact harm onto her, and that’s something she has a difficult time understanding even after leaving. This song is filled with ethereal gospel hums and serves as a closure to the first part of the album.
</p>
</div>

<!--Thoroughfare-->
<div id="Thoroughfare">
    <p>
        Ethel in her lonesome meets her new lover, Isaiah, in “Thoroughfare” on an empty road in Texas, where she hops into his pickup truck. Ethel, with nowhere to go, tags along with Isaiah as they both search for meaning in their lives in their drive from Texas to California. Eventually, with all the time they spend together in motels and on the road, they become infatuated with each other. Ethel sings, “‘Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck / Is the only place I think I’d ever wanna be.”
    </p>
</div>

<!--Gibson Girl-->
<div id="Gibson Girl">
    <p>
        The theme of sexuality is elaborated on in the song “Gibson Girl” as the relationship blossoming between Isaiah and Ethel turns abusive. Ethel becomes a victim to Isaiah’s exploitation of her as he sells her into prostitution and feeds her drugs. This song highlights Ethel’s sense of reality being lost. The chorus starts off slow and hazy, a parallel to Ethel’s helplessness and loss of control. “And if it feels good, then it can’t be bad,” is Isaiah gaslighting Ethel into believing that what she’s being forced to do is her own will, and she feels a sort of adrenaline rush to the ‘rebellion’ she is partaking in. This however quickly comes to an end.
    </p>
</div>

<!--Ptolemaea-->
<div id="Ptolemaea">
    <p>
        This album takes a much darker turn with the ninth song, “Ptolemaea,” which is another one of my favorites. In the context of Dante’s Inferno, Ptolemaea, is a section of the ninth circle of Hell specifically designed to house those who betrayed their guests. Isaiah ‘welcomed’ Ethel into his space, only to take advantage of her naivety and loyalty by killing her. Ethel also feels like a betrayer to her family and bloodline.
        <br><br>  
        Ethel and Isaiah are separated in their beliefs through the line “You love blood too much / But not like I do.” Ethel has loved Jesus and devoted her life to him, however, Jesus never came around for her, she was left to die at the hands of Isaiah. Her love for God was ultimately ignored, just as she was in her final moments, where Isaiah ends up murdering and cannibalizing Ethel. Their juxtaposing love for blood divides them. Ethel craves the purity in the blood of Jesus, while Isaiah craves the feeling of pleasure he will gain by slaughtering Ethel, through the shedding of her blood. 
        <br><br>
        Ethel experiences horrifying hallucinations due to the drugs that Isaiah has been giving her. Everything she sees and is describing is distorted, and the song comes to its climax as we hear Ethel’s blood curdling cries for Isaiah to stop.
    </p>
</div>

<!--August Underground-->
<div id="Audust Underground">
    <p>
        “August Underground” is introduced as the first instrumental track in the album. The entirety of the three minutes and forty seconds of distorted, aching voices and almost disturbing instrumentals represents the slow and painful death catching up to Ethel. With the lack of lyrics, Ethel is muted in her final moments. This song marks the death of Ethel for good as Isaiah carries out his deed. 
    </p>
</div>

<!--Televangelism-->
<div id="Televangelism">
    <p>
        The instrumentals continue with the second song on the album without vocals. However, this song is much different than the last. We hear piano and ambient noise, and instead of representing the slaughtering act itself, “Televangelism” builds a sense of tranquility and peace with Ethel’s ascension from her body to the afterlife.
    </p>
</div>

<!--Sun Bleached Flies-->
<div id="Sun Bleached Flies">
    <p>
        Ethel makes peace with her life in “Sun Bleached Flies” and reflects on her life, family, and the man she never stopped loving—Willoughby. Ethel’s otherworldly voice makes its return with the duality of feelings towards her childhood and the way she was raised. There is yearning to go back along with an expression of the hurt and pain she was put through. In death, Ethel craves the comfort of church and religion. 
        <br><br>
        As Ethel sings, “God loves you, but not enough to save you / So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself,” she echoes the paradox of someone or something that loves you can also betray you. She had experienced this with every man in her life, including Jesus. Ethel ends the song regretfully wishing for the house in Nebraska, connecting back the simple and peaceful love she shared with Willoughby.
    </p>
</div>

<!--Strangers-->
<div id="Strangers">
    <p>
        Preacher’s Daughter comes to an end with “Strangers,” which is my ultimate favorite song from the album. This song is a goodbye from Ethel as she addresses Isaiah and what he has done to her.
        <br><br>
        With the lines, “Freezer bride, your sweet divine / You devour like smoked bovine hide / How funny, I never considered myself tough,” Ethel describes her ‘resting place.’ Part of her body is stuck laying in a freezer for whenever Isaiah desires her. She describes her flesh as ‘tough’ to chew, which brings some humor in her own death. As opposed to “Sun Bleached Flies,” this song is a different kind of reflection of Ethel’s death:
        <br><br>
        “I tried to be good, am I no good?
        <br>
        Am I no good? Am I no good? 
        <br>
        With my memory restricted to a polaroid in evidence
        <br>
        I just wanted to be yours, can I be yours?
        <br>
        Can I be yours? Just tell me I'm yours
        <br>
        If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick
        <br><br>
        Am I making you feel sick?"
        <br><br>
        Isaiah betrayed Ethel’s trust to the highest degree and desecrated her body. Despite this, she shows concern to ask if Isaiah consuming her flesh is making him ill, either from the fact that she is ‘tough’ or from sheer guilt. Because she does not have a proper resting place, Ethel angrily ‘turns in her grave’ which happens to be Isaiah’s stomach: “If I’m turning in your stomach and I’m making you feel sick.”
        <br><br>
        The repetition of her questions “Am I no good?” and “Can I be yours?” refer to Ethel’s constant bending to the will of the men in her life. She has never been free, and even in death she cannot be free. In “Sun Bleached Flies,” Ethel claimed she was making peace with her death. In “Strangers,” Ethel shows that she in fact can’t move on from what happened to her. She will always be swinging from the family tree. She will never find peace. The song concludes as Ethel calls out to her mother in pity,
        <br><br>
        “Don’t worry ’bout me and these green eyes / Mama, just know that I love you (I do) / And I’ll see you when you get here.” 
    </p>
</div>
<!--Conclusion-->
<div id="Conclusion">
    <p>
        “Preacher’s Daughter” truly is a work of art, and I can only hope I at least emulated a portion of its greatness in what I have written. What I love most about the storytelling here is the metaphor echoed throughout the lyrics and songs: You must deal with your generational trauma, with your past, and try to heal. This album is a cautionary tale as to what happens when you don’t confront your traumas. Not choosing to heal is self-destruction, which is what happened to Ethel. 
        <br><br>
        I implore all you who are reading to give this album a listen--I promise it is worth the try.
