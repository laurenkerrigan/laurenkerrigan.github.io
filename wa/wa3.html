        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p> As a writer of fiction and an avid enjoyer of reading, there’s nothing I enthuse over more than listening to music that has a story to tell.
            <br><br>
            With all the books I can get my hands on, I can never put them down without leaving annotations. I pore over the words on the page and take them in with consideration, I find meaning in the smallest things, and I pay attention to the details otherwise glossed over because stories are meant to be contemplated and consumed. I don’t only do this with my books, I do this with everything. Honestly, I can’t help myself. 
            <br><br>
            I did this recently with an album I discovered about a year ago by an artist I truly admire. “Preacher’s Daughter” by Ethel Cain (which is what she’s more notoriously known by. Her real name is Hayden Silas Anhedönia) is a haunting work of fiction filled with the intricacy of spirituality and its motifs and southern gothic aesthetics. This album takes us on a journey with a troubled teenager, who is the preacher’s daughter, in her small southern town where she grapples with sexuality and her own religious trauma. 
            <br><br>
            But before you give this album a listen, because listening to religious turmoil in song form is sooo exciting, I feel like it would be incredibly beneficial to have some kind of understanding of the plot. By spending the past year listening to this album and continuously being amazed by the complexity in the lyricism, I feel confident in giving you a step-by-step beginner’s guide to the genius that is Ethel Cain’s debut album. 
            <br><br>
            The fictional character Ethel Cain loses lover after lover as she tries to develop her sense of self outside the church, but throughout the course of the album she is kidnapped and sold into prostitution. After trying to escape, her captor eventually killed and cannibalized her. Yes, you read that correctly. He eats her.
            I’ll take the liberty to put a disclaimer here now, I will be (as briefly as I can) talking about abuse, cannibalism, grooming, abuse, murder, and of course violence. Read and listen at your desire.

<h2>Family Tree(Intro)</h2>
<p>The first song on the album is "Family Tree(Intro)", which sets the story in 1991. The structure of the story starts with a voice echoing in a church cathedral, who we can assume to be the preacher, Ethel's father. The themes of Christianity and intergenerational trauma are interwoven immediately with Ethel's words,
    <br>"Jesus can always reject his father / But he cannot escape his mother's blood / He'll scream and try to wash it off his fingers / But he'll never escape what he's made of."
    <br>Ethel describes the torment of being tied to something you desperately want to rid yourself of, and how she will always be tied to her family's bloodline with the lyric of, "Swinging by my neck from the family tree." With this imagery, Ethel is willingly dubjected to her trauma, which serves as foreshadowing for the rest of the album.

<h2>American Teenager</h2>
<p>“American Teenager” sets the scene in a small town in Alabama, where Ethel describes feeling frustrated over not being able to live the idyllic life of an American teenager. This song focuses on the glamorization of the stereotypical teenage lifestyle and what it promises growing kids, but the actual chance of it becoming real is nonexistent to Ethel. The start of her disconnection with God and religion comes from the line, “Jesus if you’re there / Why do I feel alone in this room with you?” 
<br><br>
    Being the preacher’s daughter, Ethel has this legacy in her hands and expectations she cannot meet with her questioning of religion. She is stuck wishing for a life that she has no real chance of getting—her faith in God is dwindling and she begins to drown her sorrows in alcohol to cope with this sudden shift in beliefs.
